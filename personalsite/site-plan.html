        InnerSub studios is a small indi developement company currently in the process of creating thier first installment, "Regret", a platform/bullet-hell/side-scroller soon to be released. The company specializes in entertaining gameplay with creative approaches towards their developement to give players a very diverse but entertaining experience playing thier games. InnerSub also appreciates close contact with anyone who supports them or there projects, and came to the desision that a website that allows for open communication between our company was appropriate, also for the purpose of recieving feedback and recommendation from fans.
        
        This site will also be a place where anyone intrested in learning the basics of 2D game development using unity can find a starting place. Following along, you can find out how to begin a movement script, create sprites, and attatch assets to a project in unity to begin turning your own ideas into life.

      <h3>Creating Assets</h3>
      <p>
        Creating assets for a game has more to do with the creativity of the developer than their abilities to game develope. When creating assets, really just let your artistic side get the better of you! There's no right or wrong when it comes to game assets, and mistakes can really be played off as an artistic desision.
        Most of the assets for "Regret" will be made with pixel art. There are many ways to draw or animate your characters, including photoshop, pixel art, or any other perfered alternative. We'll focus mostly on pixel art, a common choice ammong indi-game developers. For "Regret," will be using Aseprite for our pixeled spritesheet.
        What is a spritesheet? Simply put, it's the foundation or building blocks of creating your game. As you can see, looking at a sprite sheet doesn't really look like much and honestly resembles more of a failed art project than anything else. But when you start putting things together peace by peace, a simple but well developed spritesheet is the beginning of an exeptional in-game terrain or player animation.
        Start by asking yourself what you want your game to look like. Where does it take place? What's the mood? Is this for a simple npc conversation or a boss fight? What do you want your player to focus on? Shown is an example of a stone and dirt spritesheet that is being used for an underground cave setting.

      <h3>Codding your game</h3>
      <p>
        Now don't get scared just yet- while coding is definately difficult, with time and practice it begins to seem more and more intuitive. Let's talk about how we can create a simple player movement script. If you remember anything from your calculus class, you'll know that the position of anything, for example an apple, can be represented by a graph. The velocity is just the change in position, and acceleration is just the change in velocity. But what does this mean in the context of movement? Well if you want your player to move, i.e. have velocity, you need to create a function of position, attatch it to a game object (like the player), and tell the game obect to have a change in position when a certain key is pressed (ex wasd). Similarly, when the player jumps, that's a simple parabola that can be codded as well. There are a lot of nitty gritty details that we can get into, but for now, the basics of a movement script are shown.
