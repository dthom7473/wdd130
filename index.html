    <p>Hey guys, my name is Dallin, I am a sophmore and I really enjoy music and production. The pictures in the background tell you a bit about my wife as well, she really likes anime and I really like music.</p>
    <p>That's pretty much it, I like building computers too and I'm looking forward to learning how to build a perty website.</p>
    <p>Cheers</p>
