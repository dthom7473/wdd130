            <p class = wet-river-text> Wet river is a river that was named after it's profound wetness. This is by far the most popular of the rivers on our rafting tour, likely because of the convenience that the name implies. This river extends from silver creek falls, Oregon, all the way down to southern mexico! The rafting trip is overnight so get ready for the worst nights sleep you've had in years! This river is one of the wettest!</p>
            <h1 class = "title">Lake River</h1>
            <img class = "lake-river-img" src = "images/Lake River.jpg">
            <p class = lake-river-text> Lake river is very appropriately named, just like Wet river, although is a little bit misleading becuase lake river is not a river at all, but rather a lake - go figure - off the side of the rocky mountains. Those who chose to take a trip over to lake river often find it's not at all what they expected, likely becuase they failed to read any of the information on our website and assumed it was a river rafting trip. I mean, it's in the name guys.</p>
            <h1 class = "title">River River</h1>
            <img class = "river-river-img" src = "images/River River.jpg">
            <p class = river-river-text> River river is probably the most relevant river we provide on our tours, as our guests know exactly what they're getting themselves into; a river. The river is wet, but lacks the wetness only found with Wet River. Though some splashes are still gaurenteed! Take a trip down River River now with your best of friends! Led by the ever popular river guied, River! It's a fun but sometimes confusing time.</p>
